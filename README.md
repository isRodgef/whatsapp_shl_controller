# whatsapp_shl_controller
Basic reverse shell that will be controlled through whatsapp using the twilio whatsapp api
but 
I created this program when I wanted to control my computer from my phone, so I decided to use whatsapp. I used twilio to handling (with ngrok port forwarding) the send of whatsapp messages to flask server.
